=head1 NAME

Games::AssaultCube::ServerQuery::Response - Holds the various data from a ServerQuery response

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Games::AssaultCube::ServerQuery;
	my $query = Games::AssaultCube::ServerQuery->new( 'my.server.com' );
	#my $query = Games::AssaultCube::ServerQuery->new( 'my.server.com', 12345 );
	#my $query = Games::AssaultCube::ServerQuery->new({ server => 'foo.com', port => 12345, timeout => 5 });
	my $response = $query->run;
	if ( defined $response ) {
		print "Server is running with " . $response->players . " players\n";
	} else {
		print "Server is not responding!\n";
	}

=head1 ABSTRACT

This module holds the various data from a ServerQuery response.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module holds the response data from an AssaultCube ServerQuery. Normally you will not use this class
directly, but via the L<Games::AssaultCube::ServerQuery> class.

=head2 Attributes

You can get the various data by fetching the attribute. Valid attributes are:

=head3 server

The server hostname/ip

=head3 port

The server port

WARNING: AssaultCube uses $port+1 for the query port. Please do not do pass $port+1 to the constructor,
we do it internally. Maybe in the future AC will use $port+2 or another system, so let us deal with it :)

=head3 pingtime

The AssaultCube-specific pingtime counter

=head3 query

The AssaultCube-specific query number we used to PING the server

=head3 protocol

The AssaultCube server protocol version

=head3 gamemode

The numeric AssaultCube gamemode ( look at L<Games::AssaultCube::Utils> for more info )

P.S. It's better to use the gamemode_fullname or gamemode_name accessors

=head3 gamemode_name

The gamemode name ( CTF, TDM, etc )

=head3 gamemode_fullname

The full gamemode name ( "capture the flag", "team one shot one kill", etc )

=head3 players

The number of players currently on the server

=head3 minutes_left

The number of minutes left on the server

=head3 map

The map that's running on the server

=head3 desc

The description of the server

=head3 desc_nocolor

The description of the server, with any AssaultCube-specific colors removed

=head3 max_players

The maximum number of players this server can accept

=head3 pong

The AssaultCube-specific pongflags number

P.S. It's better to use the pong_name accessor

=head3 pong_name

The AssaultCube-specific pongflag name

=head3 player_list

An arrayref of players on the server

P.S. Don't forget to enable get_players in the constructor to L<Games::AssaultCube::ServerQuery>, it
defaults to an empty arrayref.

=head3 is_full

Returns a boolean value whether the server is full or not

=head3 datagram

The actual packet we received from the server

=head3 tohash

A convenience accessor returning "vital" data in a hashref for easy usage

=head3 timestamp

The UNIX timestamp when this response object was generated
