Games::AssaultCube::Log::Line::GameStatus - Describes the GameStatus event in a log line

=head1 ABSTRACT

Describes the GameStatus event in a log line

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module holds the "GameStatus" event data from a log line. Normally, you would not use this class directly
but via the L<Games::AssaultCube::Log::Line> class.

This line is emitted once in a while as the AC server goes through the game.

=head2 Attributes

Those attributes hold information about the event. As this class extends the L<Games::AssaultCube::Log::Line::Base>
class, you can also use it's attributes too.

=head3 gamemode

The numeric AssaultCube gamemode ( look at L<Games::AssaultCube::Utils> for more info )

P.S. It's better to use the gamemode_fullname or gamemode_name accessors

=head3 gamemode_name

The gamemode name ( CTF, TDM, etc )

=head3 gamemode_fullname

The full gamemode name ( "capture the flag", "team one shot one kill", etc )

=head3 map

The map name ( sometimes it's a zero-length string... )

=head3 minutes

The number of minutes remaining in the game

=head3 mastermode

The numeric AssaultCube mastermode of the server

	0 = OPEN
	1 = PRIVATE ( passworded )
	2 = NUM ( full )

=head3 mastermode_name

The name of the mastermode on the server ( OPEN, PRIVATE, NUM )

=head3 finished

A boolean indicating if the game is finished or not
