Games::AssaultCube::Log::Line::DemoStop - Describes the DemoStop event in a log line

=head1 ABSTRACT

Describes the DemoStop event in a log line

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module holds the "DemoStop" event data from a log line. Normally, you would not use this class directly
but via the L<Games::AssaultCube::Log::Line> class.

This line is emitted when the AC server stops recording a demo.

=head2 Attributes

Those attributes hold information about the event. As this class extends the L<Games::AssaultCube::Log::Line::Base>
class, you can also use it's attributes too.

=head3 datetime

The DateTime object representing the time when the server stopped recording the demo

=head3 gamemode

The numeric AssaultCube gamemode ( look at L<Games::AssaultCube::Utils> for more info )

P.S. It's better to use the gamemode_fullname or gamemode_name accessors

=head3 gamemode_name

The gamemode name ( CTF, TDM, etc )

=head3 gamemode_fullname

The full gamemode name ( "capture the flag", "team one shot one kill", etc )

=head3 map

The map name

=head3 size

The size of the demo ( in bytes )
