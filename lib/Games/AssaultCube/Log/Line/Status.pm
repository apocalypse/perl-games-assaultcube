=head1 ABSTRACT

Describes the Status event in a log line

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module holds the "Status" event data from a log line. Normally, you would not use this class directly
but via the L<Games::AssaultCube::Log::Line> class.

This line is emitted once in a while as the AC server goes through the game.

=head2 Attributes

Those attributes hold information about the event. As this class extends the L<Games::AssaultCube::Log::Line::Base>
class, you can also use it's attributes too.

=head3 datetime

The DateTime object representing the time this event was logged

=head3 players

The number of connected players

=head3 sent

The number of Kbytes sent per sec ( float )

=head3 recv

The number of Kbytes sent per sec ( float )
